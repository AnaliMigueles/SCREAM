### Hello!
This repository contains the source code for our lab's Shiny app located at:
https://sanchezalvaradolab.shinyapps.io/SCREAM/
 
 The app was created from our manuscript "*Assigning cell identity to bulk RNA-seq transcript trends using single cell mRNA signatures*"
 With this app, users  look for overrepresentations of scRNA-seq mRNA signatures in their bulk RNA-seq clusters of interest.
